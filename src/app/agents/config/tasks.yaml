# =============================================================================
# BAR GROWTH ADVISOR CREW TASKS
# =============================================================================

advise_bar_growth:
  description: |
    Provide strategic bar growth advice based on the user's current cabinet
    and what bottles would unlock the most new drink possibilities.

    CURRENT BAR STATUS:
    {cabinet_contents}

    DRINKS YOU CAN MAKE (Core Bottles Only - Kitchen items assumed available):
    {makeable_drinks}

    BOTTLE RANKINGS (by unlock potential):
    {ranked_bottles}

    ESSENTIALS STATUS (Bitters & Specialty Syrups):
    {essentials_status}

    IMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY:
    - We track CORE BOTTLES: spirits, modifiers, non-alcoholic spirits
    - We ASSUME kitchen items (fresh produce, mixers) are available
    - Essentials (bitters, specialty syrups) are nice-to-haves, not requirements
    - Focus recommendations on bottles that unlock the MOST new drinks

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the user's current bar and identify their strongest categories
    2. Look at the ranked bottles and identify the #1 best purchase
    3. Provide 2-3 additional recommendations as alternatives
    4. If they're missing key essentials (like Angostura bitters), mention it
    5. Give encouraging advice about what milestone they're building toward
       (e.g., "You're 2 bottles away from mastering the classics!")

    Be conversational, encouraging, and specific. Reference actual drink names
    they'll be able to make. Make building a home bar feel achievable!
